# Privacy Policy
Thanks for using baseline!

baseline is owned and operated by BASELINE HEALTH, incorporated as a Domestic Nonprofit Organization in the State of Oregon, USA. This privacy policy will explain how we use the data we collect from you when you use our website, app, and other services.

baseline collects your email address when you sign in with Apple or Google. If you’d rather we didn’t have your email, you can use a private email address when signing in with Apple. (Google does not have an equivalent feature.) We do not collect any other personally identifiable information. We may use your email address to send you informational emails about baseline (likely asking for feedback or the like).

The only data we ever get about you is the data you give us when using our services. Even then, though, we can’t see the vast majority of what you submit to our services. Here’s what we can technically see:
- Given email address (can be obfuscated with Sign In With Apple)
- Timestamps of mood logs
- Timestamps of surveys, and names of surveys completed
- Whether you’ve enabled Personal Data Protection, and what type (upfront/discreet)
- Plain text of any Gap Fund requests you submit (which, of course, we need to process your request)

Other than the use of your email address detailed above, though, our internal data use policies forbid us to view any of this data in any deanonymized fashion without express permission from the user. We have no interest, financial or otherwise, in figuring out who you are and matching any of this data to you or any personal identifiers, and we never will.

All other data you submit to us is encrypted with keys that are unique to each user, are stored by each user individually, and thus cannot be accessed by us no matter what:
- Contents of mood logs (written portion, average, mood score, image storage location, etc.)
- Scores/Results on surveys
- Image data

Your data is processed and stored within Google Cloud Platform in the United States. Google does not own any of the information you submit to baseline. You can learn more about Google Cloud Platform’s data processing and privacy agreements [here](https://cloud.google.com/privacy).

We will never sell or otherwise provide any of your information to any third party. Ever. Since most of the information anyone would ever want from baseline is encrypted with keys we don’t possess, we don’t really have much to give away anyways. User keys are also further encrypted by baseline. We will fight as hard as we need to to protect our internal keys to keep user data safe from people and organizations that wish to access it (including but not limited to state-level actors).

baseline has no interest in selling you anything. You won’t be receiving marketing emails from us.

### So, how does baseline make money, then?

baseline is a free and completely open-source piece of software, developed and maintained by us because we believe everyone deserves quality, free mental health care, no matter who they are or what their situation is. We believe it is unethical and irresponsible to put this type of support behind a subscription.

baseline is funded through donations, and by income sharing commitments made by our creator. [If you’d like to donate to support us, please do! Everything helps, and every dollar goes directly to baseline.](https://paypal.me/nisalakalupahana)

You are entitled to the following rights, no matter where you live (we guarantee you these rights even if they aren’t given to you by your local laws):

The right to access – You have the right to request copies of your personal data. 

The right to rectification – You have the right to request that we correct any information you believe is inaccurate. You also have the right to request we complete the information you believe is incomplete. Note that this does not apply to private data we don’t have access to, like your mood logs.

The right to erasure – You have the right to request that we erase your personal data.

The right to restrict processing – You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.

The right to object to processing – You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.

The right to data portability – You have the right to request that we transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.

If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. Most of the important rights here (data access & erasure) can be done automatically from the baseline settings menu. However, you can also exercise any of these rights manually by contacting us at [privacy@getbaseline.app](mailto:privacy@getbaseline.app).

All of our cookie and other local storage use is for required website functionality only.
