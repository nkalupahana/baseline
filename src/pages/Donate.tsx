            <p className="text-center margin-bottom-0">Thank you for considering a donation to baseline. Financial contributions
                are what allow us to run programs like the gap fund, and help this app continue to scale and reach more people.
                If you're able to contribute, send it to our <a href="https://paypal.me/NisalaKalupahana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">PayPal.</a> More 
                donation options will likely be coming soon as the gap fund expands, but email us if you need a different method. (Donation
                money never goes to expenses like salaries or bonuses â€” baseline is a 100% volunteer operation.)
            </p>
            <p className="text-center">Of course, financial contributions aren't the only ones that help. If you have programming expertise, consider
                contributing to baseline itself. This project is completely 
                open source on <a href="https://github.com/nkalupahana/baseline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub.</a> And of course, 
                if you have any feedback, please send it our way at <a href="mailto:feedback@getbaseline.app">feedback@getbaseline.app</a>.
