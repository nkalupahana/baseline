                Mental health isn't just (or even primarily) about clinical diagnoses. Much more of it is simply about living a happy,

                Notice your baseline falling? You might want to make a conscious effort to bring more things into your life that you
                typically associate with higher mood scores. If your baseline has fallen significantly, or isn't rebounding, you should to
                take some time to reflect on what might've changed in your life that led to that.

                Mood logging is a great start to that process &mdash; we recommend that you review your mood logs to look for any changes.
                And of course, professional help is the best way to really figure out what's going on. Check out our help resources in the
