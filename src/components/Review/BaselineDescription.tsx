                Mental health isn't just (or even primarily) about clinical diagnoses. 
                Much more of it is simply about living a happy, healthy life. To help people better 
                understand this, we created the baseline. It tracks your "average" mood, so you can 
                see how your base level of happiness changes over time. The numbers 
                don't mean anything by themselves, so don't compare this graph with other 
                people. What matters is how <i>your</i> baseline changes as time goes on. 
                (And if you don't see a trend, don't worry about this just yet.)
            </p>

                Notice your baseline falling? You might want to make a conscious effort to bring more things into your life that you
                typically associate with higher mood scores. If your baseline has fallen significantly, or isn't rebounding, you should to
                take some time to reflect on what might've changed in your life that led to that.

                Mood logging is a great start to that process &mdash; we recommend that you review your mood logs to look for any changes.
                And of course, professional help is the best way to really figure out what's going on. Check out our help resources in the
