            baseline is different from "daily" journals in that it's specifically designed to 
            capture how you're feeling <b>in the moment</b>, a few times a day. This might be
            the first time you've tried something like this, but don't worry &mdash; journaling
            is a skill, just like anything else, and there's no one right way to do it.

        <p>
            Now, sometimes, you might just want to write a sentence 
            and be done. But most of the time, you should try to 
            describe <b>what you've been doing</b>, <b>how you've been feeling</b>,
            and <b>why you might be feeling that way.</b>

            and some deeper reflection on it as needed.

            These entries don't capture what was going on, and have no meaningful reflection. 
            Remember, the more reflection you do in the moment, the more you'll discover, and the more 
            context you add, the more you'll be able to remember when you look back on your entries!
