                    <p>
                        About your last survey: it sounds like you're in an abusive relationship.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, we want you to remember that you have the right to be safe, and the right
                        to be treated with respect. You are not to blame for this, and you deserve a safe 
                        and happy life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Abusive relationships aren't salvageable, and by staying in them or trying to "fix"
                        the abuser, the abuser's behavior is further reinforced. You deserve better. 
                        We urge you to try to get out of this relationship. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That being said, we understand that it's always harder than "just leaving". 
                        As a first step, we recommend confiding in someone you know about what's going on.
                        Talking to others is a good way to sort out your feelings and get immediate help.
                        If you need additional help, advice, or a second opinion for getting out of your 
                        relationship, you should also reach out to one of these hotlines:
