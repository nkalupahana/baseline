                        Your answers have indicated that you have issues with substance abuse, 
                        and likely have a substance use disorder. Even if you don't think your substance use 
                        is an issue, we highly recommend reaching out to a professional to talk about 
                        your specific circumstances. Substance use can easily spiral into a bigger issue, is 
                        often also indicative of other mental health struggles, and can impact many other 
                        facets of your life. It's really important that you get help.

                        Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and similar organizations are a big help for lots of people
                        who are struggling with substance use. Additionally, if you're in the US, we recommend going to 
                        <a href="https://www.findtreatment.gov/">findtreatment.gov</a> to find specific professional support for
