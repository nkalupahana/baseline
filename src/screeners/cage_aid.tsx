                    Based on your answers, we do not believe you have a substance use disorder. If you're worried you might 
                    be developing an issue with substances, contact a professional for help. Additionally, if you're worried about

                        Hi there. Your answers have indicated that you have issues with substance abuse, 
                        and likely have a substance use disorder. Even if you don't think your substance use 
                        is an issue, we highly recommend reaching out to a professional to talk about 
                        your specific circumstances. Substance use can easily spiral into a bigger issue, and is 
                        often also indicative of other mental health struggles.
