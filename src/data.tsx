export const TALK_TO_SOMEONE = <>
    Mood logging is already a great start. If you have 
    someone in your life that you trust and can talk with about what's happening, reach out to them. 
    We know it's hard, but it's almost always worth it. If what you're going through involves those people, 
    you can also talk with someone on a site like <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://7cups.com">7 Cups</a>, 
    a free and confidential emotional support community with trained listeners.

export const RESILIENCE_EXP = <>
    Resilience is a measure of how well you can cope mentally and emotionally with a crisis, 
    and how quickly you can move on from it without suffering longer-term consequences. It's an important 
    metric to keep track of &mdash; if you're low on it, stress could have a much bigger 
    impact on you than it would normally.
